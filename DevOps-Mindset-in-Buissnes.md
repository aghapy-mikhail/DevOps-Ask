The main difference between the public cloud and a data center is where the data is stored. In a data center, data is most often stored on the premises of your organization. Some data centers may be in locations not owned by your organization—in this case, your data center is colocated, but not in the cloud. The cloud is completely off premises and your data is accessible from anywhere via the internet.
